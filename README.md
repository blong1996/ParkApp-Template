# ParkAppLayout

This project orininally began as a project for a local startup called Brown Box Works here in Greensboro, NC. It was going to be used as a platform to be sold to theme and amusement parks all accross North Carolina. 

Due to cancellation of the project, the app was never sold leaving behind a template very similar to the photo sharing app, Instagram.

The app was built using the Ionic Framework and is ran using the terminal commands mentioned on the [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) website.
